This update disables the OOM killer by default, as it wasn't as thoroughly
tested as existing solutions, and requires more work to be done in the
wider OS space to be as useful. We also removed the unnecessary code
that was purpoted to allow triggering this OOM killer, the kernel
documentation makes it clear that it wasn't necessary.

The README was also updated with more information, and updated links to
various similar projects.

This update changes the API to send the warning as an integer between 0 and
255, rather than a string. It offers the opportunity to add more separate
warnings in between the already set levels.

This update fixes a bug that made all the low memory warnings trigger
at the same time, during full stalls.

A configuration file was also added which controls whether the OOM killer
is triggered on critically low memory. This should probably be disabled
(as a default through a compile-time option) until user-space takes a
more proactive role in reducing memory usage.
